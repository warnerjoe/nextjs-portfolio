            <p>I'm Joe, a dedicated full stack software engineer from Milwaukee, WI. 
                With a strong foundation in Javascript, I specialize in crafting efficient and functional web applications. 
                My journey in web development began with a curiosity for how websites work. As a young person growing weary of the limitations of Geocities, 
                I taught myself HTML and CSS and began building pages in Notepad. Thankfully, I have moved onto VS Code.
                Over the years, I've honed my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and other modern technologies. 
                I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously learning to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
                When I'm not coding, you can find me on stage performing improv comedy, gaming, or exploring the great city of Milwaukee. 
                I'm excited to share my work with you and look forward to any opportunities for collaboration.</p>
